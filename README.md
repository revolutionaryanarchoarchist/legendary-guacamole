following the historic tradison of physics students, missundersanding the general shitiness and futality of thermodynamics generally for a failing of the many many avleble textbooks and going on write thair own, in a horifiingly missguided atempt to make essey the "onderstandingg" of this horible, frustrating and rather boaring subject. as it turns out how ever knowing that the aformensioned is nothing but the shared delusion of evry student of the subject (that may or may not result in a rpetetive book depending on whether the student is having a manic episote while first encountering the subject), dose not stop me from doing the same.
so heres my atempt i guess
